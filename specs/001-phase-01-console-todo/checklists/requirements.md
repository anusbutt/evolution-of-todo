# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 1 - Console Todo Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASS

All checklist items passed on first validation iteration. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning phase (`/sp.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- 5 comprehensive user stories with priorities (2 P1, 1 P2, 2 P3)
- 25 detailed acceptance scenarios covering all operations
- 8 edge cases documented with expected behaviors
- 20 testable functional requirements
- 10 measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Clear assumptions section documenting scope boundaries

**Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All requirements are complete and unambiguous based on the feature description and industry-standard practices for console applications.
